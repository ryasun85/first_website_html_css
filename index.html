    <h3 class="aboutme">About me :</h3>
    
        <p> 
            Through my experience working within an IT recruitment I have developed a keen interest in coding and new technologies.
            During my own time I decided to look into online courses and tutorials (w3schools, CS50, Free Code Camp) and gained some fundamental knowledge in HTML, CSS, basic C, Python and general core principles like variables, arrays, loops etc. 
            <br>
            Throughout this education path I acknowledged that I have a strong desire to continue a career within this industry. I am in pursuit of an apprenticeship or junior developer position where I can put my current knowledge into practice, learn and develop new skills and grow with the business. 
            <br>
            My professional history has equipped me well with the skills required to work independently and as a part of a team, adhere to deadlines, practice efficiency and quality. I believe these attributes, along with my strong desire to learn and progress will make me a valuable member of your development team.
            <br>
            I am a very enthusiastic person who loves people and new challenges. In my free time I enjoy various activities like yoga, pilates and body pump. Travelling is another passion of mine. I especially like to learn about other cultures and how people live in different societies. I have now visited 20 countries and I am ready for my next adventure:)
        </p>
    
    <h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>

        <p>
            Technology has multiple purposes within businesses in the modern world with mainly improving efficiency and security on a daily basis.
            <br>
            Use of a different software/application helps businesses organise their daily tasks. For example you can assign it to different members of the team and overlook their work in progress. Provide on the go updates and feedback helps avoid mistakes and doing the same work over and over again. 
            <br>
            Beside improving business communication it also speeds up communication with clients and helps improving their overall experience.
            <br>
            With recent changes in GDPR policy it helps making sure that date kept by the business is secure. 
            Technology also helps creating company culture when employees get social over social media or simply get together playing games.
        </p>

    
    <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects
        successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What
        Skills?
    </h3>

        <p>
            To complete digital projects we can use multiple methods available, skills and resources. 
            <br>
            Based on the type of project we would use different methodology like Scrum, Kanban or Waterfall.
            Kanban is a methodology I have used on a project before creating planing  board on Trello. This helps divide tasks between member of the team which is working on the project and also control the progress of the particular tasks. Having certain parts of the projects divided into smaller chunks often helps correcting errors faster. 
            <br>
            As in recent world things are changing very fast Agile methodologies help quickly adapt to changes which may occur since the beginning of actual planning what we wanted to do at the start.
            To be able to deliver the project one often needs good organisational and leadership skills as is good to have one person overlooking the project’s progress. Stand up meetings are great to do that. Obviously, let's not forget about technical skills!
            <br>
            Online we can find multiple tools to help us organise the project and making sure it goes smoothly.
            I have previously used Trello, draw.io for initial planning but also google presentation to be able to show bigger audience the outcome. Different things can be found throughout multiple channels like google, Quora, Stackoverflow etc.
        </p>

    <h3> 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?
    Include a link to your Trello board.
    </h3>

        <p>
            The key thing would be to decide on the look of the website and what I am trying to achieve in terms of positioning items/text on the website, if I want multiple pages etc. In general this would be deciding what user can see.
            <br>
            As a second step either physically using posted notes or draw.io I would create a flowchart/prototype of how I want this website to look like. 
            <br>
            After this I would create a trello board with main tasks which need to be completed and their brief description. As this would be one person project rather than a team task I would be updating my Trello board with new ideas/tasks on the go then decide if they are worth or not worth adding. I would also need to decide on the time when those tasks need to be completed to make sure I can meet the deadline.  
        </p>

    <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital
        projects to fail? Why?
    </h3>

        <p>
            There are various risks which can impact the project and cause it to fail. Very often this starts in an initial part of planning and understanding what we are actually have to do and trying to achieve. 
            If the criteria are not clear this will cause problems and delays in further stages of planning and delivering. 
            <br>
            Good project management is the key. We need to make sure we take under consideration different factors like for example illness of team member which can automatically cause delay. Make sure we assign time to review project at the end or test it if is for example a website. If there are no regular updates of individual persons’ progress this can often cause time problems and delays again. Based on the scope of projects there are plenty of external risks like investors pulling out or competition being ahead.
        </p>

    <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software –
        how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?
    </h3>

        <p>
            I would definitely spend time to research and  find case studies to better understand other people or businesses’ solutions. It would be also worth to have a chat with people who have done it before as they could give good advice based on their experience.
            <br>
            Good research would help me establish most efficient system/software I can use for this particular task. I would also have to take into consideration my personal skills and level I am at atm. If for example the project was suppose to be coded and could be done in 2 different languages - one I have experience and other I would have to learn from scratch - I would need to decide on pros and cons and pick more efficient solution. 
            <br>
            I would have to assess the potential future risks make sure that the software I use would be long time solution. Some businesses often use cheaper product and then face issue as is hard to write additional functions to it in the future.
        </p>

    <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you
        achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and
        GitHub help with your codes version control
    </h3>

        <p>
            On the game project I have created I found Draw.io very helpful. Having a flowchart is very beneficial as is great to revisit tasks, ideas and understand what next steps you need to take. I am also a person who respond to visual aids hence is great to have a draft like this I can keep coming back to. It helps with organisation of thoughts. 
            <br>
            Trello is a great tool to use especially to track progress of my task. Having 3 columns Do, Doing and Done helped me have a better understanding of what needs to be done and what steps need to be taken. Great tool to organise tasks. Is also very flexible and helps adding ideas on the go.
            <br>
            Github is a great tool especially for sharing my code. Is an easy way to show people what I have done and also for others to make changes or contributions if we work on the same project.
        </p>

    <h3>
        1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does
        GDPR impact digital projects? 
    </h3>

        <p>
            GDPR is a European Union set of rules (agreement) for storing and manipulating personal data. The main reason this was put in place is to give individuals more control over their data and being able to assess how it is being processed. Businesses from outside of EU are also obligated to follow the rules if they operate within the EU.
            <br>
            The data protection is very beneficial to individuals who can easily request to be removed from databases of businesses. It solves a lot of issues with for example unwanted email communication. 
            It has a huge impact on delivering digital project very often causing delays and also increase in price for the product for an end user.
            <br>
            Having to follow new GDPR restriction businesses often have to have someone overlooking this which is an additional cost of employing another person. For businesses doing SaaS this  can cause delays at testing stage. Testing often has to be done with data which now has to be anonymised/encrypted before being used in the testing.

    <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
    </h3>

        <p>
        To create my website used Visual studio to write code in and and Trello board to plan ahead what main tasks I need to complete. I have not used draw.io board as this is a one person project and I had an idea in my head of what I am trying to achieve and what my website should look like. I also kept changing ideas on the go.
        <br>
        Trello has been useful to remember what I need to come back to and also to prioritise tasks. 
        I am very pleased with Visual Studio as has a lot of build in helpful functions.
        <br>
        With VS is really easy to see if there is for example bracket missing due to color coding. Is also great as it keeps reminding you about closing tags.
        </p>


    <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>
        
        <p>
        Visual Studio is a great tool especially for someone who is still at the beginning of their code journey. It has been very helpful with its color coding for HTML and CSS as well. Very easy to find missing brackets or semicolons due to this. 
        <br>
        Trello is definitely an appropriate tool to use for the website. Considering this is one person project it can be beneficial but wouldn't say it is necessary. Still helps remembering and organizing tasks.
        </p>
        
    <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
    </h3>
    
        <p>
        There are always improvements which can be made to the final projects. Having a limited amount of time to complete the project I tried to concentrate on making something visually easy on the eye so the person who is actually assessing it can easily read the content. I believe this has been achieved. I think visually looks quite nice.
        <br>
        In terms of weaknesses I have centered the text but I would like to put tabs to each part of the paragraph. Having researching this quite a bit I found a way to do this to first line of the text in a paragraph but not to the further ones(in the same paragraph). Based on that I decided to go with a centre option.
        </p> 


    <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
        
        <p>
        If I had more time to create the website I would definitely look more into color contrast to make it more visually harmonised. I would also consider changing fonts to be more coordinated/alike so the text is easier on the eye. I would spend more time resizing gmail logo as there has been a big issue with trying to make it the same size as Linkedin one next to it.
        <br>
        As this is a basic project where we are supposed to include answers to questions asked I tried to keep it quite simple so is easily readable. If I had more time I would probably make it more complex with links and other pages with for example more details about me or some other extra info.
        I would also spend more time trying to get indentation better in paragraphs rather than centre.
        </p>

    <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
        
        <p>
        Looking backwards and the outcomes I believe I matched the requirements. I have prepared relevant content - answered all the questions asked. I have created simple Trello board to keep track of my progress. I have done some research on formatting and tried to apply this to make my page easily readable and included jump links to navigate easily. I have tested the page on the go and at the end to make sure all is working and also read up the content for spelling mistakes. 
        </p>

    <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
    </h3>

        <p>
        I really enjoy working with Visual Studio as makes my work much easier. The color coding of brackets and attributes is perfect solution for a begginer.It makes it really easy to read and find error if needed. Good with adding automatically closed tags as it shows which ones need to be closed and helps remember that.
        <br>
        I like Trello board but for one person project is not that necessary. I believe is much more useful if this would be a team work.
        I would probably think a bit longer about the overall design as I have been doing things on the go rather than having full concept in my head. Probably taking a bit of time and planning that would have nicer outcome. I guess creativity will come with more experience :)
        </p>


    <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h3>
        
        <p>
            Defintelly initial planning is very helpful as further down the line I would have a better idea and could concentrate on coding only. Using Kanban methodology and dividing tasks into smaller chunks is a great idea as it helps organising things and also gives more of a sense of achievement. Is easier to approach smaller tasks than be faced with one big one. If this was more complex project I would probably introduce better time management. I could be very flexible as it was just me working on it but this would be different if this was a team work.
        </p>


    <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h3>
    
        <p>
        If this was a team project I would definitely use Slack. Is a great tool for communication between people and having a catch up were people are with their work. Is good for quickly passing piece of code for others to review. 
        
        I would use Github if this was more complex/team project so people could communicate and maybe make changes to the code on one platform rather than everyone having their own code in VS.
        I would use trello more in initial stage to plan tasks better and also draw Flowchart to have better visual idea of what I am trying to achieve.
        </p>
        
    <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
        
        <p>
        I would check how does the website work in the different browsers as people using various ones these days. Another thing would be to test if is responsive and if can be viewed on different screen sizes like on the phone, TV, iPad etc.
        <br>
        See how fast the website is loading to make sure all the improvements are done and is quite fast. Make sure all the links work fine and all the elements are positioned correctly. Probably get a couple of people to user test it and make comments and suggestions how UX can be improved.
        </p>

    <h2 id="Unit2out1">Unit 2, Outcome 1</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
        <p>
            I have decided to go with a simple layout and all content on one page to make it easy and readable.
            <br>
            The text is easily accessible when we scroll down through it. I have also on the top included a menu bar with jump links to main points (Outcomes) so users can find the answers quicker rather than scrolling down through the whole content.
            <br>
            I have used a picture as a background and placed text on partially see through background so it can be visible as well.
        </p>

    <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h3>

        <p>
            Copyright is put in place to make sure original work is protected. As images, text, videos are often someone's intellectual property this helps to make sure people get credit for their work and its not used without their permission. If we are looking to use someone else’s work - for example graphic - we need to ask for permission, credit the person or pay them for using their work. 
            <br>
            Very important rule for creating website these days is also their accessibility. We should make sure that websites are easily accessible for people with disabilities for example people with poor vision. (Looking at color contrast could be beneficial)
        </p>

    <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that
        people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome
        Them
    </h3>
        <p>
            When we think about accessibility is not just for people with disabilities but we also have to make sure our website can be easily used on different devices like for example mobile phones or TVs. Is worth having a think about who will be our audience first to be able to plan ahead.
            <br>
            Based on the different disability type we can provide different solution. For example for people with hearing problems there can be more description so they can read a bit more about the content. For people with vision problem would be good to do verbal explanation if possible. Also using color contrast can help them see things on the website better. Another option is also to zoom the content so is more readable. Some people find it hard to use keyboard so is good to plan ahead how we navigate around our page to make sure is easy for all.
        </p>


    <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites. </h3>
        <p>
            There are various files we can use while creating websites. The main ones would be HTML to create the structure and CSS to apply style. Based on what we would like to include on our page we can use different files.
        <br>
            If we would like to put pictures on it then we could use JPEG/JPG. We can use GIFs for short videos or AVI files for longer ones. For text files we can use TXT and to attach documents we can use DOC or PDF types. Music can be added as MP3 files. If we are working with large/multiple files we can ZIP them.
        </p>
